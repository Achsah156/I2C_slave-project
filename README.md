Built using Verilog
#  I2C Slave Project using Verilog

##  Overview

This project implements an **I2C Slave module** using **Verilog HDL**, simulating the behavior of an I2C-compatible peripheral device. It demonstrates communication with an I2C Master using SDA (Serial Data Line) and SCL (Serial Clock Line) to receive and transmit data.

> âš™ This is a fundamental project in Digital Design and Computer Architecture that enhances understanding of serial communication protocols and hardware description languages.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Start/Stop Condition Detection**
- **7-bit Address Recognition**
- **Read/Write Control**

##  I2C Protocol Brief

- **I2C** (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave, packet-switched, single-ended serial communication protocol.
- Only **2 lines** are needed: `SCL` (clock) and `SDA` (data).
- Data is transferred in 8-bit format followed by ACK/NACK.
